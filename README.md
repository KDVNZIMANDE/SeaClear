Cape Townâ€™s stunning beaches are a major attraction for both residents and visitors. The city's beautiful coastline and mild Mediterranean climate offer the perfect setting for various seaside activities. However, issues with water quality, particularly during busy times, pose significant health risks. Despite concerns, many beachgoers are unaware of the poor water quality due to inadequate communication methods. Reports have highlighted high levels of pollutants at some beaches, leading to serious health issues for swimmers.

Our Mission
The purpose of the SeaClear project is to provide Capetonians and tourists with real-time, accurate water quality information for local beaches through a mobile-friendly website. By offering this crucial data, the platform aims to enhance public health and safety, empowering users to make informed decisions about where to swim.

Our Vision
We envision a future where every beachgoer in Cape Town has easy access to up-to-date information on water quality, ensuring a safer and more enjoyable beach experience. Our goal is to foster a well-informed community that values both the beauty of Cape Town's beaches and the importance of maintaining their health and safety.
